EECS 486 final project

musicnotes.py: Contains our MusicNotes class and essentially all functions we use to detect single notes, multiple notes, as well as the parsons code. 
It also has the code that interacts with the musipedia SOAP API that takes the calculated parsons code in as input

driver.py: Performs all of our tests :)
